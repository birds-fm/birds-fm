<h2>
    Information we use
</h2>

<p>
    When you authenticate via a third-party service like Twitter, we may collect, process, and
    change content from that third-party account like user name, TWEETS, user names of people you
    follow
    to use by Text-To-Speech Service that installed on
    your mobile device.

    We are not responsible for any third-party Text-To-Speech services you are using, so you need to
    read and
    accept their Privacy Policy and Terms of Use to use the Application.
</p>

<p>
    We use activity detection based on Google APIs to understand your current activity like DRIVING,
    WALKING, RUNNING, CYCLING or STANDING.
    We may collect, store and process that information to automatically turn on the Application.
